# Weather-App

This is a weather app that allows users to search for the weather of any city they want by entering the city name in the search bar. The app retrieves the temperature, sunrise and sunset time, wind speed, cloudiness, and location data by fetching the API from https://openweathermap.org/. 
Additionally, the app features a background image relevant to the city that the user searches for, which is achieved by fetching the image from https://unsplash.com/.
